A collection of resources, links, books, hacks and tricks related to Kubernetes and DevOps technologies in general.

In my journey learning K8s, I realized there are many tricks and hacks that come with the job as the ecosystem becomes ever more heterogeneous.
I find myself reading for hours through Github Issues in obscure repos in order to find a snippet of code that can solve my use case.

I decided to start saving and organizing those valuable resources not just for me but for everyone that might need them in the future.

If you find something interesting related to K8s, container technology, DevOps, MLOps or anything in between, please consider creating a PR to include it in the list.

## Projects

- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/): A tool for running local kubernetes cluster using Docker container as "nodes".

### Machine Learning Ops (MLOps)

- [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/): The Machine Learning Toolkit for Kubernetes.

### Operators

- [Zalando](https://github.com/zalando/postgres-operator) A postgresql operator for K8s. Commes with Helm Charts.

### Examples
